> Data Structures and Algorithms are the building blocks of computer science. They are the tools you'll use to build software systems. This section is a collection of resources to help you understand and master Data Structures and Algorithms.

If you're new to Data Structures and Algorithms, start with the [Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms](/docs/dsa/) guide.

```mermaid

    A --> C(Algorithms);
    
```

I'd be glad to create a comprehensive response for your Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) roadmap, incorporating the best aspects of previous suggestions and addressing potential shortcomings:

### Data Structures

Data Structures are the fundamental building blocks used to organize and store data efficiently. Here are some common data structures you should be familiar with:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Data Structures] --> B(Array);
    A --> C(String);
    A --> D(Linked List);
    A --> E(Stack);
    A --> F(Queue);
    A --> G(Tree);
    A --> H(Graph);
    A --> I(Hashing);
    A --> J(Heap);
    A --> K(Trie);
```

- **Array**: A collection of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations.
- **String**: A sequence of characters.
- **Linked List**: A linear data structure where elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations.
- **Stack**: A linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
- **Queue**: A linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
- **Tree**: A non-linear data structure used to store data hierarchically.
- **Graph**: A non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges.
- **Hashing**: A technique used to uniquely identify objects.
- **Heap**: A complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property.
- **Trie**: A tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings.

### Algorithms

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures used to solve problems or perform computations. Here are some common algorithms you should be familiar with:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Algorithms] --> B(Sorting);
    A --> C(Searching);
    A --> D(Recursion);
    A --> E(Dynamic Programming);
    A --> F(Greedy Algorithms);
    A --> G(Divide and Conquer);
    A --> H(Brute Force);
    A --> I(Bit Manipulation);
    A --> J(Graph Algorithms);
    A --> K(String Matching);
```

- **Sorting**: Arranging elements in a specific order.
- **Searching**: Finding a specific element in a collection of elements.
- **Recursion**: A technique where a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Making locally optimal choices at each step.
- **Divide and Conquer**: Solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems.
- **Brute Force**: Solving problems by trying all possible solutions.
- **Bit Manipulation**: Algorithmically manipulating bits or binary digits.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Solving problems on graphs.
- **String Matching**: Finding a substring within a string.
