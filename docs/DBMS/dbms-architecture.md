# DBMS - Architecture

The design of a DBMS depends on its architecture, which can be centralized, decentralized, or hierarchical. The architecture can also be classified as single-tier or multi-tier.

## Single-Tier Architecture

In a single-tier architecture, the DBMS is the sole entity where the user directly interacts with and uses it. Any changes made here directly affect the DBMS itself. However, this architecture lacks convenient tools for end-users, making it more suitable for database designers and programmers.

## Two-Tier Architecture

A two-tier architecture involves an application through which the DBMS is accessed. Programmers use this architecture to access the DBMS via an application, with the application tier operating independently of the database in terms of operation, design, and programming.

## Three-Tier Architecture

The three-tier architecture is the most widely used to design a DBMS, as it separates tiers based on user complexity and data usage:

- **Database (Data) Tier**: This tier houses the database along with query processing languages and data relations.
  
- **Application (Middle) Tier**: Here, the application server and programs that access the database reside. This tier presents an abstracted view of the database to end-users, acting as a mediator between them and the database.
  
- **User (Presentation) Tier**: End-users operate on this tier, unaware of the database's existence beyond this layer. The application can provide multiple views of the database, generated by applications in the application tier.

The multiple-tier database architecture is highly modifiable, as its components are independent and can be changed independently.
