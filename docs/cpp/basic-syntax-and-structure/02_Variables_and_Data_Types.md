# Variables and Data Types in C++

## Data Types

C++ is a strongly-typed language, meaning every variable must be declared with a data type.

### Primitive Data Types

- **int**: Integer type.
- **double**: Double-precision floating point.
- **char**: Character type.
- **bool**: Boolean type (true or false).

Example:

```cpp
int number = 10;
double price = 9.99;
char letter = 'A';
bool isCppFun = true;
```

### Derived Data Types

Derived data types are created from fundamental data types.

- **Array**: A collection of elements of the same data type.
- **Pointer**: A variable that stores the memory address of another variable.
- **Reference**: A reference to another variable, often used in functions.

Example:

```cpp
int numbers[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int* ptr = &number;
int& refNumber = number;
```

## Variables

Variables store data values and must be declared before use.

### Variable Declaration

```cpp
int age;
char grade;
```

### Variable Initialization

```cpp
age = 25;
grade = 'A';
```

### Combined Declaration and Initialization

```cpp
int age = 25;
char grade = 'A';
```

## Conclusion

Understanding C++ variables and data types is fundamental to writing efficient and effective C++ code. By mastering these concepts, you can work with different types of data and create dynamic and robust applications in C++.
