# C++ Syntax and Structure

## Introduction

Understanding the basic syntax and structure of C++ is essential for writing effective C++ programs. This guide covers the fundamental elements of C++ syntax and how to structure a C++ program.

## Basic Syntax

### Hello World Example

The simplest C++ program is a "Hello, World!" application. Here's what it looks like:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Header File**: The `#include <iostream>` line includes the input/output stream library, allowing us to use `cout` and `endl`.
- **Main Function**: The `main` function is the entry point of any C++ application. It returns an integer value (`int`) indicating the exit status.
- **Output Statement**: The `std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;` statement prints the specified message to the console.

## Comments

Comments are used to explain code and are ignored by the compiler.

- **Single-line comments** start with `//`.

```cpp
// This is a single-line comment
```

- **Multi-line comments** are enclosed in `/* ... */`.

```cpp
/*
 This is a multi-line comment
 that spans multiple lines.
 */
```

## Data Types and Variables

C++ supports various data types such as `int`, `double`, `char`, `bool`, etc., and allows the declaration of variables using the syntax `datatype variableName;`.

```cpp
int age = 25;
double salary = 50000.50;
char grade = 'A';
bool isEmployed = true;
```

## Control Structures

C++ provides control structures like `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, and `switch` for conditional and looping operations.

```cpp
if (age >= 18) {
    std::cout << "You are an adult." << std::endl;
} else {
    std::cout << "You are a minor." << std::endl;
}
```

## Functions

Functions in C++ are declared using the syntax `returnType functionName(parameters) { ... }`.

```cpp
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int result = add(5, 10); // result = 15
```

## Conclusion

Understanding the basic syntax and structure of C++ is foundational to becoming proficient in C++ programming. By mastering these concepts, you can write efficient and reliable C++ code for various applications.
