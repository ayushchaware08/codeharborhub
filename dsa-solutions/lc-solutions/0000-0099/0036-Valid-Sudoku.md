## Problem Description

Determine if a $9 \times 9$ Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

- Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
- Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
- Each of the nine  $3 \times 3$ sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Note:

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

### Examples

#### Example 1:

**Input**: board = 
```
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
```
**Output**: true
#### Example 2:

- **Input:** board = 
```
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
```
**Output:**  false

**Explanation**: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left $3 \times 3$ sub-box, it is invalid.


### Constraints

- board.length == 9
- board[i].length == 9
- board[i][j] is a digit 1-9 or '.'.

### Approach

âœ” HashSet Initialization: The algorithm uses a HashSet (seen) to keep track of unique elements encountered during the traversal of the Sudoku board.

âœ” Traversing the Board: The algorithm uses nested loops to iterate through each cell of the 9x9 Sudoku board.

âœ” Checking Rows, Columns, and Sub-boxes
ðŸ‘‰ For each non-empty cell (cell value not equal to â€˜.â€™), the algorithm checks if the current digit is already present in the same row, column, or $3 \times 3$ sub-box using HashSet operations.

ðŸ‘‰ Unique string representations are used to identify rows, columns, and sub-boxes. (donâ€™t worry, will explain it ðŸ˜Š)

âœ” Returning Validity:

ðŸ‘‰ If all the checks pass for a given cell, the digit is added to the HashSet to mark it as seen.

ðŸ‘‰ The traversal continues until all cells have been processed.

ðŸ‘‰ If any violation is detected during the traversal (i.e., a digit is repeated in a row, column, or sub-box), the function returns false, indicating that the Sudoku board is not valid.

ðŸ‘‰ If the traversal completes without encountering any violations, the function returns true. Thatâ€™s mean Sudolu board is valid.

### Solution Code

#### Python

```
class Solution:
  def isValidSudoku(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
    seen = set()

    for i in range(9):
      for j in range(9):
        c = board[i][j]
        if c == '.':
          continue
        if c + '@row ' + str(i) in seen or \
           c + '@col ' + str(j) in seen or \
           c + '@box ' + str(i // 3) + str(j // 3) in seen:
          return False
        seen.add(c + '@row ' + str(i))
        seen.add(c + '@col ' + str(j))
        seen.add(c + '@box ' + str(i // 3) + str(j // 3))

    return True

```

#### Java

```
class Solution {
  public boolean isValidSudoku(char[][] board) {
    Set<String> seen = new HashSet<>();

    for (int i = 0; i < 9; ++i)
      for (int j = 0; j < 9; ++j) {
        if (board[i][j] == '.')
          continue;
        final char c = board[i][j];
        if (!seen.add(c + "@row" + i) || //
            !seen.add(c + "@col" + j) || //
            !seen.add(c + "@box" + i / 3 + j / 3))
          return false;
      }

    return true;
  }
}
```

#### C++

```
class Solution {
 public:
  bool isValidSudoku(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
    unordered_set<string> seen;

    for (int i = 0; i < 9; ++i)
      for (int j = 0; j < 9; ++j) {
        if (board[i][j] == '.')
          continue;
        const string c(1, board[i][j]);
        if (!seen.insert(c + "@row" + to_string(i)).second ||
            !seen.insert(c + "@col" + to_string(j)).second ||
            !seen.insert(c + "@box" + to_string(i / 3) + to_string(j / 3))
                 .second)
          return false;
      }

    return true;
  }
};
```

### Conclusion

The above solution efficiently finds if the sudoku configuration is valid or not in $O(1)$ time complexity.
