In this section, you will learn about the solutions of the problems of Data Structures and Algorithms. 

## Data Structures

- [Array](#): Array is a collection of elements of the same type placed in contiguous memory locations that can be individually referenced by adding an index to a unique identifier.
- [String](#): A string is a sequence of characters.
- [Linked List](#): A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.
- [Stack](#): A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
- [Queue](#): A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
- [Tree](#): A tree is a non-linear data structure that is used to store data in a hierarchical manner.
- [Graph](#): A graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of a finite set of vertices and edges.
- [Hashing](#): Hashing is a technique that is used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects.
- [Heap](#): A heap is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property.
- [Trie](#): A trie is a tree-like data structure that is used to store a dynamic set of strings.

## Algorithms

- [Searching](#): Searching is the process of finding a specific element in a collection of elements.
- [Sorting](#): Sorting is the process of arranging the elements of a collection in a specific order.
- [Recursion](#): Recursion is a technique in which a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem.
- [Dynamic Programming](#): Dynamic Programming is a technique used to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems.
- [Greedy Algorithms](#): Greedy Algorithms are algorithms that make a series of choices that are locally optimal at each step.
- [Backtracking](#): Backtracking is a technique used to solve problems by making a series of choices and backtracking when a choice leads to a dead end.
- [Divide and Conquer](#): Divide and Conquer is a technique used to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems, solving the subproblems, and combining the solutions to solve the original problem.
- [Bit Manipulation](#): Bit Manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or binary digits.
- [Graph Algorithms](#): Graph Algorithms are algorithms that operate on graphs to solve problems.
- [Mathematical Algorithms](#): Mathematical Algorithms are algorithms that solve mathematical problems.
- [String Algorithms](../dsa/category/string-algorithms): String Algorithms are algorithms that operate on strings to solve problems.
